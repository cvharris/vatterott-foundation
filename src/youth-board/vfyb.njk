  <p class="page-description">
    In 2000 the Vatterott Foundation extended its tradition of giving by forming the Vatterott Foundation Youth Board (VFYB). The Youth Board is comprised of Vatterott descendants aged 13 to 30 who are interested in giving back to their community in the spirit of their ancestors.
